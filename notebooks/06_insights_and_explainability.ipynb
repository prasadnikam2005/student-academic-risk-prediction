    "## Key Insights from the Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Several important patterns emerged from the analysis and modeling process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Past academic failures are the strongest indicator of future academic risk.\n",
    "2. Attendance plays a critical role, with higher absences significantly increasing risk.\n",
    "3. Behavioral factors such as social activity also contribute to performance outcomes.\n",
    "4. Demographic factors have relatively lower influence compared to academic history.\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights align closely with real-world educational intuition, increasing trust in the model.\n"

    "## Why the Decision Tree Was Selected\n",
    "\n",
    "Although multiple models were evaluated, the controlled Decision Tree was chosen as the final model because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It captures non-linear academic risk patterns.\n",
    "- It provides rule-based, human-readable explanations.\n",
    "- It avoids excessive complexity through depth control.\n",
    "- It offers stable performance across different student profiles.\n",

    "\n",
    "The system explains predictions in simple terms that educators can understand.\n",

    "- Multiple past academic failures\n",
    "- Low weekly study time\n",
    "- High number of absences\n",
